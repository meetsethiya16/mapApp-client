# MERN Project with OpenStreetMap Integration

This is a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) project that features OpenStreetMap (OSM) integration to display the user's current location. The application provides authentication functionality, allowing users to log in securely and access a dashboard with a real-time location display.

Features
User Authentication: Users can log in with the provided credentials:

Username: user01

Password: userPass

OpenStreetMap Integration: Uses react-leaflet to render an interactive map displaying the user's current location.

Real-Time Location Tracking: Retrieves and updates the user's position dynamically using the browser's Geolocation API.

Secure Backend: Implements authentication with JWT and securely stores user credentials in a MongoDB database.
